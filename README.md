[Quantum Summer](https://quantumsummer.world/) is an audio-visual meditation on the future of blackness, technology, and ancestral memories. It is inspired by the canon of black radical energy, maroon communities, and black beaches. Each area of the Quantum Summer ecosystem has its own soundtrack, created by an eclectic mix of NYC-based Black artists. It was selected for Sundanceâ€™s New Frontiers 2021 program, as a part of Traveling the Interstitium with Octavia Butler.

A small group of 5 artists, idris brewster, Terence Nance, Ari Melenciano, Sophia Nahli Allison, and Stephanie Dinkens, got together with the Guild of Future Architects to create their own 3D portals inspired by the life and work of author Octavia Butler.

The landscape, and 3D models were created by Micah404 using Quill. The environment, audio-reactive visuals, and spatialized audio were developed by Torin Blankensmith using Three.js and Shader Park.

Music composed by keiyaA, iblss. and Shay Buttah.
Lyrics written by skate key, keiyaA, AKAI SOLO, and maasai.
